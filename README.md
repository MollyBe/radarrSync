# RadarrSync
Syncs movies with a defined resolution in one Radarr to another Radarr server through web API.  

### Why
Many Plex servers choke if you try to transcode 4K files and more importantly cannot transcode HDR correctly. To address this we create another library of 1080p content mirrored from 2160p downloads in the master Radarr.

Radarr does not support saving files to different folder roots for different quality profiles. I recommend using the attached script - FolderQuality.sh - if you wish to do that.

This script looks for movies with a specific quality setting on one server and create the movies on a second server.


### Configuration
 1. Edit the Config.txt file and enter your servers URLs and API keys for each server.  

    Example Config.txt:
    ```ini
    [General]
    # Time to wait between adding new movies to a server. This will help reduce the load of the Sync server. 0 to disable. (seconds)
    wait_between_add = 5

    # Full path to log file
    log_path = ./Output.txt

    # DEBUG, INFO, VERBOSE | Logging level.
    log_level = DEBUG

    [RadarrMaster]
    url = http://127.0.0.1:7878
    key = XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX

    [SyncServers]
    # Ensure the servers start with 'Radarr_'
    [Radarr_1080p]
    url = http://127.0.0.1:17879
    key = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    [Radarr_720p]
    url = http://127.0.0.1:27879
    key = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

    # Only sync movies that are in these root folders. ';' (semicolon) separated list. Remove line to disable.
    # WIll check if this path exists
    rootFolders = /Movies
    # Current path of Radarr Master
    current_path = /Movies/
    # Replace with this path on the Sync Server
    new_path = /Movies/sort

    # This is the profile ID the movie will be added to.
    profileIdMatch = 4
    resolutionMatch = r2160P
    bitrateMatch =

    # This is the resolution ID the movie must have on the Master server.
    profileId = 1
    ```
 2. Find the resolutionmatch on the Master server. "r2160p" "r1080P" "r720P".
 3. Change profileId configuration to what you want the profile to be on the SyncServer.


#### How to Run
Recomended to run using cron every 15 minutes or an interval of your preference.
```bash
python3 RadarrSync.py
```
To test without running use:
```bash
python3 RadarrSync.py --debug --whatif
```
#### Requirements
 -- Python 3.4 or greater
 -- 2 or more Radarr servers
